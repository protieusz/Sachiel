# Sachiel
Sachiel, inspired by Grumpy, 34 keys custom keyboard with 25mm trackball

# Description
Sachiel is a 34 keys custom keyboard with an integrated 25mm trackball.
Even though Sachiel is inspired by Grumpy but the KLE layout is done from scratch with added missing keys. Nothing from the Grumpy's design was taken for modding i.e the pcb files or the stl. 
Sachiel name was derived from one of the angels of an anime.

The missing keys of Q, P, B and N were added to make it a standard 30 alpha keys. The win key and the enter key were add to row 3 and 10 of the layout.
The 2 keys, backspace and space were shrink to 1U.

The keeb is power by RP2040 Core-A mcu which you can get from AE. The rest of the components are purchased from LCSC.

The components are pcba by me using a hot plate and some hand soldering for the mcu, ESD, fuse, USB C and the switches. During designing, due to spacing issue for the ESD and the fuse, I got them to appear to the top side of pcb.

PMW3360 sensor is used for the trackball as per usual.

As for the case design, I have tried printing in both PLA and matte resin. The PLA has a good switch friction fit and working integrated trackball holder but the resin had loose switch holes and super super tight fitting M2 inserts. So print resin at your own risk I didn't use resin for this build.

As for the trackball ball, you can refer to my previous different designs for reference. Overall POM ball works the best for me. Other balls are hit and miss. Build this keeb on your own risk.

QMK code is the same modified from aki27's bally code. I don't how the code works and I just integrated my matrix and some trial and errors and it works now.
